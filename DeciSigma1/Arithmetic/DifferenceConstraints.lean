/-! # Systems of difference constraints

A system of difference constraints over a finite index type `ι` is a set of inequalities
`x i + c ≤ x j` between integer unknowns; it is the constraint graph with an edge `i → j` of
weight `c` for each inequality. The shortening arguments choose the number of letters to
delete from each periodic factor, and the lengths of the periodic continuations of several
words, as solutions of such systems.

A closed walk of positive weight makes a system infeasible. Conversely, if there is no
positive cycle, the maximal weights of simple walks give a nonnegative solution bounded by
`|ι|` times the largest edge weight (`exists_sat_nonneg_bounded`). Above given lower bounds
there is then a least solution, and each of its values is reached from a vertex at its lower
bound along a duplicate-free path of tight constraints (`least_above`); this is how the
shortening bounds the size of the least solution.

## Main declarations

- `DifferenceSystem`, `DifferenceSystem.Sat`: systems of difference constraints and their
  solutions.
- `DifferenceSystem.weight`, `DifferenceSystem.HasPositiveCycle`: weights of walks and positive
  cycles.
- `DifferenceSystem.exists_sat_nonneg_bounded`: a system without positive cycles has a bounded
  nonnegative solution.
- `DifferenceSystem.exists_long_solution`: such a system has a natural-number solution above
  any lower bounds.
- `DifferenceSystem.least_above`: the least solution above lower bounds, with tight paths.
- `DifferenceSystem.ofFinset`: the system of a finite set of constraints.
