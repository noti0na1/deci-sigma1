/-! # Sign-symmetric solutions selected from a least shape

The signed translation of a constraint is closed under the involution that exchanges the two signed
copies of each variable, reverses the constructor literals and exchanges `⊥` and `⊤`. For such a
constraint the least shape `B` and its sign dual have the same constructor positions, and reading
`B` at paths of even signed polarity and its sign dual elsewhere gives a symmetric assignment
(`select`). The selected assignment solves the signed translation whenever `B` does (`select_sat`),
and it has bounded depth whenever `B` has; this gives finite solutions.

## Main declarations

- `SignSelection.flipV`, `SignSelection.FlipClosed`: the sign involution and closed constraints.
- `SignSelection.SameShape`: trees with the same constructor positions.
- `SignSelection.leastShape_sameShape_signedDual`: the least shape and its sign dual have the same
  shape.
- `SignSelection.select`, `select_sat`, `select_fixed`, `select_depth`: the selected symmetric
  solution.
