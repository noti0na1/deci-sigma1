/-! # Compression of runs and the bound on rejected tails

A hole whose immortal rejected tails are covered by designated runs is shortened one period
class at a time. A *pass* takes a designated run of largest period and applies an admissible
deletion to its class (`Holes.Periodic`), which keeps the hole, its endpoints and its first
rejected cuts, and preserves the other designated runs
(`exists_preserved_piece_of_nonconjugate_root`).
The occurrence height of the class is bounded by the number of states, the designated runs and
the uncovered positions (`occurrenceHeight_le`): pieces with pairwise comparable followers end at
distinct live states before the first rejected cut, and at most two of them end in each
designated run. So after the pass the processed runs have at most `pieceLengthBound` letters
each and count as uncovered letters (`exists_hole_compressed_step`). After all runs are
processed the immortal rejected tails are bounded by `compressionLengthBound`
(`exists_hole_tail_le_compressionLengthBound`). With `exists_hole_with_run_cover` this gives the
rejected-tail bound `tailLengthBound` (`rejectedTailBound_tailLengthBound`).

## Main declarations

- `occurrenceHeight_le`: the occurrence height of a class in a hole with a run cover.
- `exists_hole_compressed_step`: one pass of compression.
- `compressionLengthBound`, `exists_hole_tail_le_compressionLengthBound`: the bound after all
  passes.
- `tailLengthBound`, `rejectedTailBound_tailLengthBound`: the bound on rejected tails.
