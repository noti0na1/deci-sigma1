/-! # Suffix chains from long windows

A word with the level cover property at level `m` has suffix chains of at most
`chainLengthBound m + N` members (`levelCoverProperty_chainBound`), a number that grows with the
level. From a long window on, the number of members is bounded independently of the level.

Let `U` be the suffix of length `b` of a word `w` whose rejected tail `[J, |w|)` has a periodic
cover by at most `P` factors of period at most `E`, with at most `T` uncovered positions, and
whose longest suffix with period at most `E` is shorter than `Y`. If
`b ≥ 1 + T + P (Y + T + 2 E P + 1)`, at most `P` occurrences of `U` start in the rejected tail
(`card_tailOccurrences_le`). Some factor of the cover meets `U` in more than
`r = Y + T + 2 E P + 1` positions; its period `p` breaks at a position `o` inside `U`, since `U`
is not a long periodic suffix. Every occurrence of `U` in the tail repeats the interval of period
`p` before `o` and the break at its copy of `o`. Among the last `r` positions before the copy of
the break, some factor of the cover has more than `2 E`; by Fine–Wilf it inherits the period
`p`, so it ends at or before the copy of the break, and it cannot serve a later occurrence,
whose interval of period `p` would cover the earlier break. Distinct occurrences in the tail are
therefore charged to distinct factors.

Along a suffix chain `b₀ < b₁ < ⋯` with `b ≤ b₀`, the member `bᵢ` gives an occurrence of `U`
ending at `|w| - bᵢ + b₀` (`suffixChain_mem_occurrences`), which starts in the tail when the
suffix of length `bᵢ` does. The members whose suffixes start at or before the first rejected
cut carry distinct live states. So every chain from a window at least
`(Q + 2) (chainLengthBound m + 1)` has at most `Q + N` steps, where `Q = pieceCountBase`
(`levelCoverProperty_chainBoundFrom`).

## Main declarations

- `exists_factor_inter_gt`: a factor of a cover meets a long interval of the tail in many
  positions.
- `card_tailOccurrences_le`: few occurrences of a long suffix start in a covered tail.
- `suffixChain_mem_occurrences`: the members of a chain give occurrences of a short suffix.
- `levelCoverProperty_chainBoundFrom`: chains from long windows have at most
  `pieceCountBase + N` steps.
