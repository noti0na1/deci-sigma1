/-! # Closed factors free of suffix occurrences

Two cuts `c < c'` of a word `x` bound a *closed* factor for a dictionary if they have the same
suffix node: the same longest suffix in the dictionary and the same state of the run before it
(`NodeClosedAt`). Repeating the factor `x[c, c')` then changes neither the states nor the suffix
nodes, up to the period `c' - c`. The bound on rejected tails repeats closed factors to build
periodic continuations, and the repetition must not create new comparisons with the suffixes of
target words; the dictionary is the suffix dictionary of the targets (`suffixDictionary`).

Among any `suffixLengthBound m N Ss bs` consecutive cuts there is a factor closed for the suffix
dictionary of at most `m` targets, at some window `B` between `bs` and
`suffixLengthEnvelope m N Ss bs`, longer than `B` and of length at most `factorLengthBound m N B`,
such that no occurrence of the suffix of length `B` of any target ends inside it, provided the
suffix chains of the targets that start at a length at least `bs` have at most the budgets `Ss`
(`exists_closed_factor_free_of_suffix_occurrences`). The base case is a pigeonhole on the suffix
nodes of cuts spaced `B + 1` apart (`exists_nodeClosedAt_of_spaced_cuts`), so
`suffixLengthBound m N [] b = factorLengthBound m N b + 1` is a polynomial in `b`. The proof is an
induction on the list of targets. For one target it follows a suffix chain while the distance to
the previous occurrence of the suffix stays below the length of the closed factor
(`Words.chain_stop_from`); the remaining targets are handled at a window at least `bs`, so their
chains from `bs` on suffice.

## Main declarations

- `suffixLengthBound`, `suffixLengthEnvelope`: the length of the search interval and the
  largest window.
- `exists_closed_factor_free_of_suffix_occurrences`: closed factors free of suffix occurrences
  of the targets.
- `exists_closed_factor_replicate`: the same for at most `m` targets with a common chain budget.
