/-! # The small-hole theorem

A structural reader that has a hole has one of total length at most `smallHoleBound σ k N`,
where `σ` is the size of the alphabet, `k` the number of starts and `N` the number of states.
The proof composes two bounds.

* The *rejected-tail bound* (`Tail.exists_hole_rejectedTailLength_le`): a reader with a hole
  has a hole whose immortal coordinates have rejected tails of length at most
  `L = tailLengthBound σ k N`. `Holes.Tail` proves it by replacing tails with periodic
  continuations and compressing their periodic factors.
* The *fresh-tuple bound* (`Fresh.exists_freshDominates_totalLength_le`): every tuple of fresh
  words of a table with `k` starts and `N'` states has a fresh dominator of total length at
  most `freshTupleBound k N'`. `Holes.Fresh` proves it by deleting repeated blocks from a
  minimal fresh tuple.

They are connected by the *cover* of a hole `W` of a reader `M` whose immortal coordinates have
rejected tails of length at most `L`: a table whose states are the states of `M` together with
a counter `0, …, L` for each coordinate. On coordinate `i` it runs `M` up to the first rejected
cut of `W i`; if the rejected tail of `W i` has length at most `L`, it then reads exactly that
tail, counting its letters, and moves to an absorbing state on every other continuation. All
coordinates of `W` are fresh in the cover (`cover_fresh`): a coordinate with a mortal endpoint
is fresh in `M`, and the counter makes a bounded tail fresh. Mapping the counter back to the
corresponding state of `W i` projects runs of the cover to runs of `M`, so a tuple that
dominates `W` in the cover is a hole of `M` with the same endpoints (`cover_project_of_dom`).

The cover has `k · (N + L + 1) + 1` states, so the fresh-tuple bound applied to it gives a hole
of total length at most `freshTupleBound k (k · (N + L + 1) + 1)`
(`exists_hole_totalLength_le_of_tails`). With `L = tailLengthBound σ k N` this is
`exists_small_hole`. Since the bound is computable, the existence of a hole is decided by
searching all tuples up to it (`decideHole`).

## Main declarations

- `cover`, `coverProjection`: the cover of a hole and its projection to the reader.
- `cover_fresh`, `cover_project_of_dom`: the hole is fresh in its cover, and dominators in the
  cover are holes.
- `smallHoleBound`, `exists_small_hole`: the small-hole theorem.
- `decideHole`: the decision procedure for the existence of a hole.
