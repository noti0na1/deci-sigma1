/-! # Cuts of an edited word

After separated sites of equal length are deleted from a word, every cut of the edited word
comes from a cut of the original word (`Words.retainedCount`, `Words.greatestPreimage`). A
*junction*, a cut at which a deleted text was removed, is the image of every cut from the start
to the end of the deleted text; of these, only the cuts before and after the deleted text are
retained, and the greatest preimage is the cut after it (`greatestPreimage_site`). The channels
of the edited tuple compare texts that may contain junctions, and these maps move such
comparisons back to the original words: if the junctions inside a comparison of edited texts
correspond on both sides and every deleted text is the same word, reinserting it on both sides
gives a comparison of original texts (`prefix_of_matched`).

The module also collects facts on parses and anchors of level `0` and of all levels that the
transport of channels uses (`relativeAnchors_eq_union`).

## Main declarations

- `IsJunction`: the junctions of an edited word.
- `retainedCount_dist`, `greatestPreimage_site`, `greatestPreimage_add_eq`: the cut map is a shift
  between sites, and the greatest preimages at and between junctions.
- `take_drop_deleteSites`: between junctions the edited text is original text.
- `prefix_of_matched`: matched junctions give a comparison of original texts.
