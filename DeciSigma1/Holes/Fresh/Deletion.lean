/-! # Block deletion

A `BlockDeletion` is the shortening step of the bound on minimal fresh tuples. It consists of an
edge `(a, b)` of the reverse trie of parses at level `t` and two depths `a + M ≤ i < j ≤ b - M`,
with `M = deletionMargin k N`, such that in every upper occurrence that traverses the edge the cuts
at depths `j` and `i` carry the same `label`. The label of a cut records which markers of levels
`1, …, t` end there (`lowerLevelTypes`) and the state of the run before the longest of them, so
equal labels give equal states at the two cuts. The deletion removes the text between these two cuts
from every traversing occurrence (`BlockDeletion.apply`). All removed texts have the same length
(`deletionLength`), and each starts and ends in the same state, so the edited runs pass through
states of the original runs (`BlockDeletion.runPrefix_apply`). The deletion of positions, its cut
map `retainedCount` and the greatest preimage `greatestPreimage` of a cut of the edited text are
those of `Words.Deletion`.

This module proves the properties of a block deletion other than the inclusion of channels:
the edited tuple is shorter, has the same endpoints, visits only states that the original
visits, stays fresh, and keeps the anchors of the original words at the images of the retained
cuts (`contextAnchors_apply`). With channel inclusion, proved in
`Holes.Fresh.ChannelPreservation`, a block deletion is a fresh domination
(`BlockDeletion.freshDominates_of_channel`).

## Main declarations

- `ValidDeletionSite`, `contextAnchors_deleteSite`: one deletion site and the anchors after it
  is removed.
- `sitePositions`, `StrictlySeparated`, `Retained`, `contextAnchors_deleteSites`: deletion of
  several sites with `Words.deletePositions`, and the anchors of the edited text.
- `deletionMargin`, `lowerLevelTypes`, `label`: the labels of cuts.
- `BlockDeletion`, `BlockDeletion.apply`, `BlockDeletion.runPrefix_apply`: block deletions, the
  edited tuple and its states.
- `BlockDeletion.freshDominates_of_channel`: a block deletion with smaller channels is a fresh
  domination.
