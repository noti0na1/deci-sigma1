/-! # Block deletions preserve channels

A channel pair of the edited tuple compares suffixes of two edited words. If no junction lies
strictly inside the comparison, or if the junctions inside correspond on both sides
(`BlockDeletion.matching`), the pair is a pair of the original channel by `prefix_of_matched`.
The remaining case is a comparison whose end lies strictly inside the upper block of a host
junction (`BlockDeletion.channel_pair_lifts_of_right_endpoint`): then the target suffix is
original text near the end of its word, and the equal labels at the two cuts of the deletion
give the same window of text and states before both cuts.

Thus every channel of the edited tuple is contained in the original channel
(`blockDeletionPreservesChannels`), and block deletions on fresh tuples of nonempty words are
fresh dominations (`blockDeletionPreservesFreshDomination`).

## Main declarations

- `BlockDeletion.matching`: junctions inside a comparison correspond.
- `BlockDeletion.channel_pair_lifts_of_right_endpoint`: comparisons ending inside the upper
  block of a junction.
- `BlockDeletion.channel`: every channel of the edited tuple is contained in the original one.
- `blockDeletionPreservesChannels`, `blockDeletionPreservesFreshDomination`: block deletions
  preserve channels and are fresh dominations.
