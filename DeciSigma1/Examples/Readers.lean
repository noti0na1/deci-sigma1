/-! # Examples of readers, holes and fresh domination

The small-hole bound `exists_small_hole` concerns structural readers, and its proof goes through
fresh dominators and minimal fresh tuples. The examples below show that each of these notions
has instances, all checked by the kernel on small tables.

## Main declarations

- `mixedReader`, `mixedReader_hole`, `mixedReader_hasMixedMortality`, `mixedReader_not_hole`: a
  structural reader with four states and two starts, a hole of it with one immortal and one
  mortal coordinate, and a tuple that is not a hole.
- `freshTable_has_shorter_fresh_dominator`: a one-start table where the word `01` has the
  strictly shorter fresh dominator `1`.
- `pairTable_isMinimalFresh`: a minimal fresh pair with an empty coordinate.
- `crossReader`, `crossReader_not_hole`, `crossReader_hole`, `cross_not_entails`: the reader
  compiled from a disjunctive entailment with two queries, an admitted pair on the channel
  between its two coordinates, and a hole, which refutes the entailment.

/-! ## The reader of a disjunctive entailment

The decision procedure compiles a constraint, its queries and a mode into a structural reader.
When the constraint is satisfiable, the entailment fails exactly when the reader of some mode has
a hole (`Full.Reduction.not_disjEntails_iff_hole`). In the mode used below, a word of coordinate
`i` is a path on which `y_i` is `⊥` and `x_i` is not. -/
