/-! # Disjunctive entailment over `{⊥, f, ⊤}`

A conjunction `χ` of flat constraints over `{⊥, f, ⊤}` with variance `c` entails the disjunction
`x₁ ≤ y₁ ∨ … ∨ x_k ≤ y_k` over a class `C` of trees when every solution of `χ` with values in `C`
satisfies one of the inequalities; otherwise a countermodel refutes all of them. In the leaf
representation of `DeciSigma1.Full.Closure`, an inequality `x ≤ y` fails in one of two modes: some
path reaches `⊤` in (the normalization of) `x` but not in `y`, or reaches `⊥` in `y` but not in `x`.
A mode `m` and a path `w` give the seed configuration that must belong to the solution and the
exclusion configuration that must not (`failures_iff_exists_leaf_witnesses`).

## Main declarations

- `Full.DisjEntailsIn`, `Full.HasCountermodelIn`, `Full.not_disjEntailsIn_iff`: disjunctive
  entailment and its countermodels.
- `Full.seed`, `Full.exclusion`: the two configurations witnessing a failed inequality.
- `Full.failures_iff_exists_leaf_witnesses`: simultaneous failure of all queries through seeds and
  exclusions.
