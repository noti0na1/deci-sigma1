/-! # Regular trees from regular leaf cones

The cones of a subtree are the residual cones of the original tree, with their signs exchanged
at paths of negative polarity. Two cones determine a tree, so finitely many cone residuals give
finitely many subtrees.

## Main declarations

- `Closure.leaf_subtree`: subtree cones are residuals, with the path polarity applied.
- `Closure.regular_of_leaf`: regular leaf cones give finitely many subtrees.
