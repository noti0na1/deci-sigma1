/-! # Deleting positions from a word

Both shortening arguments of the small-hole theorem delete a finite set `D` of positions from
each word of a tuple. This module defines the operation and its effect on cuts, letters and
runs.

The edited word `deletePositions w D` keeps the letters of `w` at the positions outside `D`.
The *cut map* `retainedCount D` sends a cut `p` of `w` to the number of retained positions
below `p`, a cut of the edited word. It is monotone, increases by one exactly at retained
positions, and is constant on every interval of deleted positions. A cut `a` of the edited word
therefore has an interval of preimages, whose greatest element `greatestPreimage D a` is a retained
position; `p ≤ greatestPreimage D a ↔ retainedCount D p ≤ a`. A *junction* is the image of a deleted
position, that is, a cut of the edited word where an interval was removed.

If the two end cuts of every maximal interval of deleted positions carry the same state, the
edited word passes through the states of the original word at corresponding cuts
(`runFrom_deletePositions_take`, `runFrom_take_deletePositions`). Between two consecutive
junctions the edited word is a factor of the original word (`take_drop_deletePositions`).

## Main declarations

- `deletePositions`, `retainedCount`: the edited word and the cut map.
- `greatestPreimage`, `le_greatestPreimage_iff`: the greatest preimage of a cut of the edited word.
- `runFrom_deletePositions_take`, `runFrom_take_deletePositions`: deleting loops of a run
  preserves the states at retained cuts.
- `firstRejection_deletePositions`: the first rejected cut of an eligible run follows the cut
  map.
- `getElem?_deletePositions_eq`: the letters of the edited word.
- `not_mem_of_no_junction`, `take_drop_deletePositions`: a stretch of the edited word without
  junctions is a stretch of the original word.
- `deletePositions_union_Ico`, `retainedCount_union_Ico_of_le`,
  `retainedCount_union_Ico_of_ge`: deleting one more interval to the right of `D`.
